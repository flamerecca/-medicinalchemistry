Bacilli Bacterial cells that are rod shaped.

Bacteriorhodopsin A protein present in Archaea

microorganisms that captures light energy and acts

as a proton pump to pump protons across the cell

membrane.

Bacteriostatic Bacteriostatic drugs inhibit the growth

and multiplication of bacteria, but do not directly kill

them.

Bactericidal Bactericidal drugs actively kill bacterial cells.

Bacteriophage A virus that invades bacterial cells.

Bad A protein that promotes apoptosis.

Barbiturates A series of synthetic compounds with

sedative properties.

Bax A protein that promotes apoptosis.

Bcl-2 and Bcl-X Proteins that suppress apoptosis.

Bcr-Abl protein A protein that is formed as a result

of a chromosomal defect called the Philadelphia

chromosome. It is related to the disease known as

chronic myelogenous leukemia.

Benign cancer or tumour A localized tumour that is

not life threatening.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia Th e term for an enlarged

prostate, resulting in diffi culty in passing urine.

Benzodiazepines A structural class of compounds

that are used as hypnotics, anxiolytics, sedatives,

anticonvulsants, and muscle relaxants.

β-Blockers Compounds that block or antagonize

β-adrenoceptors. Particularly useful in cardiovascular

medicine.

Beta-lactamases see lactamases.

β-Lactams Structures that contain a four-membered

β-lactam ring and are commonly used as antibacterial

agents.

Bile duct A duct leading from the liver to the

intestines. Some drugs and drug metabolites are

excreted through the bile duct, but can be reabsorbed

from the intestines.

Binding region A region within a binding site that is

capable of a specifi c intermolecular interaction with

drug or endogenous ligand.

Binding site Th e location where an endogenous

molecule or drug binds to a macromolecule.

Normally a hollow or cleft in the surface of the

macromolecule.

Bioavailability Refers to the fraction of drug

that is available in the blood supply following

administration.

Bioequivalence studies Studies carried out to ensure

that the bioavailability of a drug remains the same

should there be any alteration to the manufacture or

formulation of the drug.

Bioisostere A chemical group which can replace

another chemical group without adversely aff ecting

the desired activity of a drug.

Bioterrorism Th e use of toxic infectious agents by

terrorist groups.

Bleomycins A group of naturally occurring

glycoproteins used as anticancer agents.

Blood–brain barrier Blood vessels in the brain are less

porous than blood vessels in the periphery. Th ey also

have a fatty coating. Drugs entering the brain have to

be lipophilic in order to cross this barrier.

Boc A shorthand term for the protecting group

t-butyloxycarbonyl.

Bromodomain A binding region in one protein that

is capable of binding an acetylated lysine residue of

another protein to allow protein–protein interactions.

Bronchodilator An agent which dilates the airways

and can combat asthma.
